# tasklist-vue-webpack

a basic tasklist app using Vue.js and Webpack. 

On my TODO list (ha!) is to create a proper blog post with some more 
details around the basics of Vue.js.

## first impression

I'm a seasoned JS developer, but new to the Vue.js world. I'm finding
(so far) that it seems to by rythmically similar to Backbone.js. If
you're comfortable working with Backbone, then I think you might feel
right at home with Vue.js vs. some of the other offerings such as
React or Angular2.

## installation

* `git clone https://github.com/erikyuzwa/tasklist-vue-webpack.git`
* `npm install`

## starting up

* `npm start`
* open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`
